	CSS Position 속성에는 5가지 값이 있음
	Position 속성은 위치를 지정하는 속성이므로 left, right, top, bottom 속성과 같이 사용할 수 있음.
	당연히 위치를 지정하기 위해 방위와 픽셀값이 필요함.

	- static : position을 지정하지 않았을 때와 같다.
			 : 기본적으로 위에서 아래로, 왼쪽에서 오른쪽 배치 
			 : 부모 요소가 있다면 부모 요소의 기준으로 배치
	- absolute : 문서의 좌측 상단 기준으로 절대 위치를 나타냄. 스크롤을 따라가지 않는다.
	- relative : static인 태그를 기준으로 위치 지정
	- fixed : 문서의 좌측 상단 기준으로 요소를 고정. 스크롤과 상관없이 고정.
	- inherit : 부모 태그의 속성값을 상속
